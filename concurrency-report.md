# **Performance Analysis Report: Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control**

## **üìù Student Names: Oskar, Peter og Yusuf**

## **üìå Introduction**

### **Objective:**

This report analyzes and compares the performance of **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)** when handling concurrent transactions in an Esports Tournament database.

### **Scenario Overview:**

- **OCC is tested** by simulating multiple players registering for the same tournament concurrently.
- **PCC is tested** by simulating multiple administrators updating the same match result simultaneously.

## **üìå Experiment Setup**

### **Database Schema Used:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
    player_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    ranking INT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE tournaments (
    tournament_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    game VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    max_players INT NOT NULL,
    start_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE tournament_registrations (
    registration_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tournament_id INT NOT NULL,
    player_id INT NOT NULL,
    registered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (tournament_id) REFERENCES tournaments(tournament_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
);

CREATE TABLE matches (
    match_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tournament_id INT NOT NULL,
    player1_id INT NOT NULL,
    player2_id INT NOT NULL,
    winner_id INT NULL,
    match_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (tournament_id) REFERENCES tournaments(tournament_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (player1_id) REFERENCES players(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (player2_id) REFERENCES players(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (winner_id) REFERENCES players(player_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

ALTER TABLE tournaments ADD COLUMN version INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
```

### **Concurrency Control Techniques Implemented:**

- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** using a **version column** in the `Tournaments` table.
- **Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)** using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` when updating `Matches`.

### **Test Parameters:**

| Parameter                             | Value              |
| ------------------------------------- |--------------------|
| **Number of concurrent transactions** | 10                 |
| **Database**                          | PostgreSQL         |
| **Execution Environment**             | Localhost / Docker |
| **Java Thread Pool Size**             | 10                 |
